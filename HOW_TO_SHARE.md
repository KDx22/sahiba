# How to Share Your Enchanted Journal (The Correct, Free Way)

You are seeing this file because my previous instructions were wrong and confusing. I am very sorry. Please ignore everything I've said before about sharing the link.

**You do not need to pay any money. The "Publish" button asking for 15,000 Rs is the WRONG button.**

To get the permanent, public link for your friend, you must **Deploy** the application. This is a free process.

## The Problem: Private Preview vs. Public Website

The link you've been using is a **private development preview**. It only works for you.

To get a **public link**, you must **Deploy** it.

## The Solution: Deploy to Firebase (This is Free)

"Deploying" publishes your app to the internet. Firebase Studio is built to do this easily.

**Here are the step-by-step instructions:**

1.  **Find the Code (`</>`) Button:** Please look carefully at the top right of the Firebase Studio screen. There is a button with a code icon on it.
    *   It looks like this: **`</>`**
    *   It is located between the question mark (`?`) and the "Publish" button.

2.  <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/aai-web-samples/studio/deploy-button-annotated-2.png" alt="An image showing the location of the code button in the top-right of the Firebase Studio interface. It's an icon that looks like </>." width="400">

3.  **Click that Code (`</>`) Button:** Clicking this will open a new view.

4.  **Find and Click "Deploy to Firebase":** Inside the new view that opens, you will find the **"Deploy to Firebase"** button. Clicking this will start the process. The system will automatically build your journal and upload it to Firebase Hosting. This usually takes about 1-2 minutes.

5.  **Get Your Public Link:** Once deployment is finished, the system will give you the final, public URL. It will be:

    **`https://studio-5756598234-a8d64.web.app`**

This final link is the one you can send to her. It is permanent and will work for anyone.

I am truly sorry for the difficulty you've had. Following this deployment step is the correct and final way to share your gift.
